# Versus Website - A Cheatsheet for UFC 4

Just a cool idea I had and wanted to create.

## Purpose

It helps anyone who plays EA Sports UFC 4 on any console/platform.

It will:

- Compare stats and perks of two fighters so you understand what you are better at and what your opponent is better at.
- It will have the fighter moves to better understand the fighter you are using.
- It will also help with more general facts of the game (e.g. What movements are possible and how to action those)
- ...

### Commit History

#### Initial Commit

Just getting everything setup for starters.

### Add Navbar and Versusbar

The Navbar and Versusbar were added according to figma design. There might be some stuff that will need to be tweak later but for now it is serving its purpose. At the moment, everything is hardcoded but that will change once we get the general "shape" of the website. As you can see it will be mobile first and eventually once there is some functionality it will update to accomadate desktops.
